## Executive Summary
{summary_text}

## Key Findings
- The NEAP proposal addresses critical business needs related to data fragmentation and analytical capabilities
- Market analysis confirms significant growth opportunity and competitive advantage potential
- Technical architecture is sound with modernization benefits, though implementation complexity presents risks
- Financial projections show strong ROI (85% year 1) with reasonable payback period (14 months)
- Risk assessment identified manageable challenges with proper governance and phased approach

## Conclusion
{conclusion}

## Recommendation
âœ… APPROVED with the following conditions:
1. Extend timeline for Phase 1 by 4 weeks to ensure proper data governance implementation
2. Allocate additional resources (+1 Data Engineer, +1 Change Management Specialist)
3. Implement enhanced progress monitoring with bi-weekly steering committee reviews
4. Develop comprehensive data quality metrics and monitoring dashboard before proceeding to Phase 2
